## How to run this?

### You can run this project and take a look at the UI and functionality.
### I have however excluded the firestore config file which has all sorts of secret keys to people's personal details.
### This means that you can't do any good submitting the registration form OR view the images in <ion-slides>
### Rest is yours!

##### 1. You need to have node js installed (goto https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
##### 2. Install angular (use npm)
##### 3. Install ionic (again, npm)
##### 4. Now run...
```
npm install
ionic serve
```

#### There will be some errors in the code because you don't have access to 'firebase.firestore.config.json'
